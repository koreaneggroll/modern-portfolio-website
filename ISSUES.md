# Issues


### Template for GitHub issues
  When you have found an issue with the source code of the portfolio website I would very much appreciate if you could create an issue with the following template

  Title: **[ Brief talk about what the issue is ]**.
  Contents: **[ What the issue is in more detail if possible and, if needed, the line of code/text where the issue was found]**.
